# Sales Insights Data Analysis 

## Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI report for analyzing sales data in a computer hardware business. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the sales director by integrating, transforming, and visualizing sales data.

## Key Components

### Data Integration and ETL

- Connected to a MySQL database containing sales transactions, customer details, product information, sales date, and market details.
- Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations using Power Query in Power BI to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- Transformed currency values by normalizing USD to INR and handled invalid or inconsistent data entries.

### Data Modeling

- Created and managed relationships between various tables in the Power BI data model to ensure accurate data representation.
- Established key relationships between sales transactions, customer data, and market information to support comprehensive analysis.

### DAX Calculations

- Developed calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform advanced calculations.
- Applied DAX to create dynamic and interactive metrics for visualizations.

### Dashboard Visualization

- Built an interactive Power BI report featuring key visualizations:
  - **Cards**: Displayed total revenue and total sales quantity.
  - **Slicers**: Enabled filtering by year and CY date.
  - **Bar Charts**: Visualized revenue and sales quantity by customer and market.
  - **Pie Chart**: Showcased the top 5 customers by revenue.
  - **Line Chart**: Illustrated monthly revenue trends.
  - **Top Products**: Highlighted the top 5 products by revenue.
